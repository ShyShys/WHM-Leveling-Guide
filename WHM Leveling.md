# Gear and Job Quests


# Glossary
* WHM: White Mage.
* CD (Cooldown): The time it takes before you’re able to cast an action again.
* GCD (Global Cooldown): Spells that share the same base recast time. On WHM, these are mostly spells with about 2.5s recast time, plus Resurrection. 
* Instant (Instant Cast): GCD Spells that do not have a cast bar.
* oGCD (Off Global Cooldown): Abilities that don’t share the 2.5s base recast time and therefore can be used while GCD spells are on cooldown.
Weaving: Using oGCDs in between GCDs. To avoid delaying your GCD, you can safely weave 2 oGCDs after an instant cast GCD, or 1 oGCD after your casted damaging GCD.
* HoT (Heal over Time): Actions that heal the target over a period of time. These actions heal for their listed potency once every 3 seconds.
* Regen: Another word for HoT.
* DoT (Damage over Time): Actions that damage the target over a period of time. These actions deal damage for their listed potency once every 3 seconds.
* Haste: Buff that reduces cast and recast time during its duration, this seems like SpS but doesn't act the same as it doesn't increase DoT/HoT damage.
* AoE (Area of Effect): Actions that affect every target in a specified area. AoE heals heal all allies in a circle around their source. AoE damage abilities affect all enemies in an area specified by the ability; enemies can perform AoE attacks too.
* HP (Health Points): Your life. Don’t let this hit 0.
* MP (Mana Points): The resource that allows you to cast spells. 

# Role Actions

# Levels 18-29
## New Skills
* *Stone (level 1)*: Single target damage (GCD).
* *Cure (level 2)*: Single target heal (GCD).

## Healing
 Your heals are bare bones here, you have Cure for single target healing and and medica for your AoE heal. Use Cure as needed for tank up keep at this level Cure does a lot of the healing you need while Medica can help with aoe healing. Do not use Medica for only tank up keep as it's significantly weaker than Cure.
## Damage
 Your DPS rotation is pretty simple, keep your DoT up without refreshing it significantly ahead of time and fill any downtime of you not casting with Stone. During dungeons you should DoT enemies as you're running with your tank and Stone when your tank stops. At level 18 Stone gets replaced by Stone II

# Levels 30-44
## New Skills
* *Cure II (Level 30)*: Single target heal (GCD).
* *Presence of Mind (Level 30)*: Self haste buff (oGCD).
* *Regen (Level 35)*: Single target HoT heal (GCD), instant cast).
* *Cure III (Level 40*: Targeted AoE heal (GCD).
## Healing
 Your healing priority change as Regen becomes extremely strong for tank up keep in dungeons, a strong 1,200 potency heal over 18s having the highest single target heal. Keeping this up during pulls can save you GCDs of healign. Cure II also becomes a staple for single target healing as the healing potency is higher than Cure I letting you waste less GCDs on healing and more on dam,age. Cure I becomes more niche if you run low on mana and can't cast anythign else but need healing. 
## Damage
 Your damage doesn't really change but you gain Presence of Mind giving you haste.
