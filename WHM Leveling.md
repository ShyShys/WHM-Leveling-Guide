# Introduction

# Glossary
* WHM: White Mage.
* CD (Cooldown): The time it takes before you’re able to cast an action again.
* GCD (Global Cooldown): Spells that share the same base recast time. On WHM, these are mostly spells with about 2.5s recast time, plus Resurrection. 
* Instant (Instant Cast): GCD Spells that do not have a cast bar.
* oGCD (Off Global Cooldown): Abilities that don’t share the 2.5s base recast time and therefore can be used while GCD spells are on cooldown.
Weaving: Using oGCDs in between GCDs. To avoid delaying your GCD, you can safely weave 2 oGCDs after an instant cast GCD, or 1 oGCD after your casted damaging GCD.
* HoT (Heal over Time): Actions that heal the target over a period of time. These actions heal for their listed potency once every 3 seconds.
* Regen: Another word for HoT.
* DoT (Damage over Time): Actions that damage the target over a period of time. These actions deal damage for their listed potency once every 3 seconds.
* Haste: Buff that reduces cast and recast time during its duration, this seems like SpS but doesn't act the same as it doesn't increase DoT/HoT damage.
* AoE (Area of Effect): Actions that affect every target in a specified area. AoE heals heal all allies in a circle around their source. AoE damage abilities affect all enemies in an area specified by the ability; enemies can perform AoE attacks too.
* HP (Health Points): Your life. Don’t let this hit 0.
* MP (Mana Points): The resource that allows you to cast spells.

## Healing
 Cure II is an upgrade over Cure letting you heal much more for more mana, Cure becomes more niche only being needed if you're low on mana. Regen becomes your best healing tool healing for 1200p over 18s this should be kept on the tank during dungeon trash pulls as it is worth almost double Cure IIs potency.
 
 Cure III becomes an upgrade over Medica with just a slightly smaller range, it cost more mana while having a smaller range so it shouldn't be used too much. Your best aoe heal becomes Medica II it becomes equal to medica with one tick and stronger than Medica with two ticks. This should be your primary aoe heal if you need to heal your party and they aren't in anger of dying.

 At level 50 you get Benediction, this should be used proactively letting tanks get low during trash pulls and instantly healing them to full as close to on cooldown as possible is the best use and it will save you a lot of effort.
## Damage
 At level 45 you gain Holy one of the best spells for dungeon mobs, it stuns for 4s for the first time, 2s for the second time and 1s for hte last time stunning mobs for 7s use this on trash packs it's what makes WHM so good for dungeons.  Use this for trash pulls always, you can go back to Stone IV if you can't stun anymore and there are only two trash mobs.
