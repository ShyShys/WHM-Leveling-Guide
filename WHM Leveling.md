# Gear and Job Quests
Always keep up to date with job quests, they give you strong spells or strong gear. At lower levels you can equip crafting/gathering gear and it does nothing for you but make your life harder, make sure your gear has mind and vitality on it. You should always aim to keep your gear up to date, roll for dungeon gear with mind on it and spend your tomestones on tomestone gear so you can equip it when you hit 50, 60, 70 and 80. You can find the vendors in Mor Dhona(50), Idyllshire(60), Rhalgr's Reach(70) and Eulmore(80). Major cities also have vendors called Sundry Splendors which sells the gear based on the zone's level.

# Introduction

# Glossary
* WHM: White Mage.
* CD (Cooldown): The time it takes before you’re able to cast an action again.
* GCD (Global Cooldown): Spells that share the same base recast time. On WHM, these are mostly spells with about 2.5s recast time, plus Resurrection. 
* Instant (Instant Cast): GCD Spells that do not have a cast bar.
* oGCD (Off Global Cooldown): Abilities that don’t share the 2.5s base recast time and therefore can be used while GCD spells are on cooldown.
Weaving: Using oGCDs in between GCDs. To avoid delaying your GCD, you can safely weave 2 oGCDs after an instant cast GCD, or 1 oGCD after your casted damaging GCD.
* HoT (Heal over Time): Actions that heal the target over a period of time. These actions heal for their listed potency once every 3 seconds.
* Regen: Another word for HoT.
* DoT (Damage over Time): Actions that damage the target over a period of time. These actions deal damage for their listed potency once every 3 seconds.
* Haste: Buff that reduces cast and recast time during its duration, this seems like SpS but doesn't act the same as it doesn't increase DoT/HoT damage.
* AoE (Area of Effect): Actions that affect every target in a specified area. AoE heals heal all allies in a circle around their source. AoE damage abilities affect all enemies in an area specified by the ability; enemies can perform AoE attacks too.
* HP (Health Points): Your life. Don’t let this hit 0.
* MP (Mana Points): The resource that allows you to cast spells.

## Healing
 Cure II is an upgrade over Cure letting you heal much more for more mana, Cure becomes more niche only being needed if you're low on mana. Regen becomes your best healing tool healing for 1200p over 18s this should be kept on the tank during dungeon trash pulls as it is worth almost double Cure IIs potency.
 
 Cure III becomes an upgrade over Medica with just a slightly smaller range, it cost more mana while having a smaller range so it shouldn't be used too much. Your best aoe heal becomes Medica II it becomes equal to medica with one tick and stronger than Medica with two ticks. This should be your primary aoe heal if you need to heal your party and they aren't in anger of dying.

 At level 50 you get Benediction, this should be used proactively letting tanks get low during trash pulls and instantly healing them to full as close to on cooldown as possible is the best use and it will save you a lot of effort.
## Damage
 At level 45 you gain Holy one of the best spells for dungeon mobs, it stuns for 4s for the first time, 2s for the second time and 1s for hte last time stunning mobs for 7s use this on trash packs it's what makes WHM so good for dungeons.  Use this for trash pulls always, you should go to Stone II if only one mob is up
 
# Levels 51-60
## New Skills
* *Afflatus Solace (level 52)*: Single target heal (GCD)
* *Asylum (level 52)*: ground target, AoE, HoT (oGCD)
* *Stone II -> Stone III (level 54)*: Single target damage (GCD)
* *Assize (level 56)*: AoE heal, AoE damage (oGCD)
* *Thin Air (level 58)*: Self MP reduction buff (oGCD)
* *Tetragrammaton (level 60)*: Single target heal (oGCD)

## Healing
From 52 you unlock Solace this is one of your three Lily spells, this should be used instead of Cure II as it does not cost mana. At level 52 you get Asylum, this should be used often as it has a low 60s cooldown and provides a powerful regen tool for anyone inside with a short cooldown. Thin Air is unlocked at 58, this is a part of your mana control tool keep one on cooldown at all times and use your extra one for high mana cost spells or a rez. At 60 you get tetragrammaton, it has a strong single target heal to help dps who get hit by an extra mechanic or to help your tank healing. This should be used often during trash pulls and should be used over cure II and Solace since it's a free heal.

## Damage
At level 54 your Stone II upgrades to Stone III, the same rules apply as above use Holy for Trash pulls and if one mob is up you can use Stone III on it as it does more damage on single target. At level 56 you gain Assize, it has a heal and a damage compontent but you want to use it near cooldown as a damage spell that has the side effect of also healing. If it's coming off cooldown  you should delay any other healing to get the healing value out of Assize while also using it for damage.

# Levels 61-70
## New Skills
* *Stone III -> Stone IV (level 64)*: Single target damage (GCD)
* *Divine Benison (level 66)*: Single Target shield (oGCD)
* *Plenary Indulgence (level 70)*: Healing buff to self and nearby party members (oGCD)
## Healing
* Divine Benison should be used as much as possible as it's a free 500p shield, use it on cooldown during a fight or prepull. Plenary Indulgence should be used if you are ever thinking of using Medica, Medica II or Cure III as it increases the healing done by a good amount on a short 60s cooldown.
## Damage
You get an upgrade to Stone at level 64, nothing changes about priority again
# Levels 71-80
## New Skills
* *Aero II -> Dia (level 72)*: Single target DoT (GCD)
* *Stone IV -> Glare (level 72)*: Single target damage (GCD)
* *Afflatus Misery (level 74)*: Targeted AoE damage (GCD)
* *Afflatus Rapture (level 76)*: AoE heal (GCD)
* *Temperance (level 80)*: Healing buff to self & Mitigation buff to self and nearby party members.
## Healing
Afflatus Rapture and Afflatus Solace is your go to GCD healing spells after unlocking Misery as you lose no damage for using them. Plenary also effects Rapture so if you need extra healing for Rapture keep that in mind. At level 80 you gain temperance, giving you a healing buff and everyone in your party a mitigation buff. Use this during pulls as it just gives your tank extra mitigation and it also increases your GCD heals including regen which is a great tool to keeo your tank healthy. 
## Damage
Unlocking Rapture changes your dps priority a bit when it comes to fights as Misery is a damage gain. Misery is damage gain but also has a  5y aoe around it. Fishing for Misery and not overcapping on Lily is something you should aim to do. You should continue to use Holy on two or more targets as the stun is great and try to Lily during downtime or priortize lily spells when healing. Holy is a damage lost on two targets compared to Glare, so try to Glare in two target situations.

# Levels 81-90
## New Skills
* *Glare -> Glare III (level 82)*: Single target damage (GCD)
* *Holy -> Holy III (level 82)*: AoE Damage (GCD).
* *Enhanced Healing Magic (level 85)*: Healing spell up
* *Aquaveil (level 86)*: Single target mitigation buff (oGCD)
* *Enhanced Divine Benison (Level 88)*: Gains a second charge of Divine Benison (oGCD)
* *Liturgy of the Bell (level 90)*: Ground target healing buff (oGCD)
## Healing
You get a lot of improved healing at level 85. Most notable is Medica II having 1,000 cure potency making it your second best gcd heal on one person. You should not go out of your way to Medica II because of this but doing a medica 2 followed by a Regen before your tanks start pulling isn't a terrible idea. Your general healing during a fight should be OGCDs and Lillies before any other healing spell. Aquaveil becomes a mitigation tool to help your tanks with tank busters and heavy auto attacks from bosses that deal a lot of auto damage try to use it often but holding it for a tank buster is okay too. At level 88 you get a second charge of Divine Benison you should always keep at least one on cooldown andthe second one can be used as an extra tank cd or to help a player who just needs a little more health.

## Damage
At level 82 Misery stops being a damage gain and becomes a damage neutral so you don't have to force yourself not to overcap on Lillies anymore for damage. Glare and Holy get upgraded, use Glare when you have nothing else to do on one or two targets. Keep your Dia up and Holy III for the stun on two targets or damage and stun on three plus targets
