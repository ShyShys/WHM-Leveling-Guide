# Glossary
* WHM: White Mage
* CD (Cooldown): The time it takes before you’re able to cast an action again.
* GCD (Global Cooldown): Spells that share the same base recast time. On WHM, these are mostly spells with about 2.5s recast time, plus Resurrection. 
* Instant (Instant Cast): GCD Spells that do not have a cast bar.
* oGCD (Off Global Cooldown): Abilities that don’t share the 2.5s base recast time and therefore can be used while GCD spells are on cooldown.
Weaving: Using oGCDs in between GCDs. To avoid delaying your GCD, you can safely weave 2 oGCDs after an instant cast GCD, or 1 oGCD after your casted damaging GCD.
* HoT (Heal over Time): Actions that heal the target over a period of time. These actions heal for their listed potency once every 3 seconds.
* Regen: Another word for HoT
* DoT (Damage over Time): Actions that damage the target over a period of time. These actions deal damage for their listed potency once every 3 seconds.
* AoE (Area of Effect): Actions that affect every target in a specified area. AoE heals heal all allies in a circle around their source. AoE damage abilities affect all enemies in an area specified by the ability; enemies can perform AoE attacks too.
* HP (Health Points): Your life. Don’t let this hit 0.
* MP (Mana Points): The resource that allows you to cast spells.

## Damage
### Summary
### New Skills
* *Stone (level 1)*: Single target damage (GCD).
  * Use this to do damage if you don't need to apply your DoT (below).
  * Because Stone has a shorter cast time than your GCD recast, you can use that window to move and/or use a single oGCD. This also applies to other spells with the same cast time as Stone, sudch as its later upgrades.
* *Aero (Level 4)*: Single target DoT (GCD, instant cast).
  * Use Aero on as many mobs as you can while the tank is pulling (since you can't cast spells while running).
  * Never apply your DoT to an enemy that is immediately about to die.
  * For dungeon pulls, do not use once you have stopped moving - use Stone instead.
  * For bosses, use every 30s to keep the DoT active until the boss dies. Try not to reapply the DoT early.
  * Because Aero is an instant cast GCD, you can move freely and/or use two oGCDs before your next GCD. This also applies to other instant  cast GCDs, including Aero's upgrades.
* *Stone II (level 18): Single target damage (GCD, replaces Stone).
